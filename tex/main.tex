\subsection*{Introduction}


The detection of lies and false information has been a topic of interest in various fields, including psychology, sociology, and criminology. One related area of focus is malingering, defined as the intentional feigning or exaggeration of symptoms for external gain in a medical setting. Malingering can significantly complicate the accurate diagnosis of mental disorders and undermine the validity of mental health evaluations.

In recent years, computational tools have been proposed to assist in the detection of malingering, utilizing advanced techniques such as machine learning algorithms, behavioral analysis, and psychological profiling (Rogers, 1997). These tools aim to provide a more objective and efficient evaluation of suspected malingering cases.

It is important to note that while malingering detection is closely related to lie detection, it specifically pertains to the deliberate feigning of symptoms in a medical setting (Gudjonsson, 2003).

In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in malingering detection and its known countermeasures. We begin by discussing the concept of lie detection and its connection to malingering. We then examine the current limitations of computational tools used for malingering detection and suggest future directions for research in this field.

The detection of lies and false information is a crucial aspect of various fields, including psychology, sociology, and criminology. In particular, the accurate detection of malingering, defined as the intentional feigning or exaggeration of symptoms for external gain in a medical setting, is of utmost importance. Malingering can significantly complicate the accurate diagnosis of mental disorders and undermine the validity of mental health evaluations.

Despite the existence of various computational tools to assist in the detection of malingering, such as machine learning algorithms, behavioral analysis, and psychological profiling, there is still room for improvement and innovation in this field (Rogers, 1997).

In this paper, our goal is to contribute to the field of malingering detection by developing a new machine learning algorithm for algorithmic lie detection. We aim to address the limitations of current tools and provide a more objective and efficient evaluation of suspected malingering cases. Our proposed algorithm achieved a accuracy of [insert number with citation], outperforming existing techniques by [insert number with citation].

The detection of lies and false information has been approached through various methods, including physiological measures, behavioral analysis, and psychological profiling. Physiological measures include the examination of physiological responses such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance, which have been linked to deception~\cite{Ganslen1990}. Behavioral analysis involves the observation and analysis of nonverbal cues and patterns of behavior, such as eye movements, posture, and gestures. Finally, psychological profiling involves the use of psychological tests, questionnaires, and interviews to examine a person's thought processes, motivations, and tendencies.

In recent years, computational tools have been developed to aid in the detection of lies and false information. These tools utilize advanced techniques such as machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to analyze patterns and correlations in physiological responses, behavioral data, and psychological profiles. The ultimate goal is to provide a more objective and efficient evaluation of suspected cases of deception or malingering.

However, it is important to note that the accuracy of these methods is still limited and subject to various biases and limitations. Further research and innovation in this field are necessary to improve the reliability and validity of lie detection techniques.

Various machine learning algorithms for lie detection have been developed and reported in the literature, utilizing different inputs such as physiological data, behavioral data, and psychological profiles.

In terms of physiological data, machine learning algorithms have been developed to analyze changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance~\cite{Ganslen1990}. For example, a study by Chan and colleagues~\cite{Chan2018}  utilized a machine learning algorithm to analyze physiological responses collected from a polygsomnographic sleep study, achieving an accuracy of [insert number with citation].

Behavioral data, such as nonverbal cues and patterns of behavior, have also been utilized as inputs for machine learning algorithms~\cite{DePaulo2003}. For example, a study by Wang and colleagues~\cite{Wang2020} developed a machine learning algorithm to analyze patterns in eye movements and gestures during a lie detection task, achieving an accuracy of [insert number with citation].

Finally, psychological profiles, such as responses to psychological tests, questionnaires, and interviews, have also been utilized as inputs for machine learning algorithms in the detection of malingering~\cite{Rogers1997}. A study by Lee and colleagues~\cite{Lee2019} developed a machine learning algorithm to analyze responses to a self-reported symptom checklist, achieving an accuracy of [insert number with citation].

These studies demonstrate the potential for machine learning algorithms to provide a more objective and efficient evaluation of suspected cases of deception or malingering. However, it is important to note that the accuracy of these methods is still limited and subject to various biases and limitations. Further research and innovation in this field are necessary to improve the reliability and validity of lie detection techniques.

Malingering is a major challenge in the field of lie detection, as it can result in false negative results and reduce the accuracy of lie detection methods. Malingering is defined as the intentional manipulation of test results for personal gain, and can take various forms, such as the use of drugs to manipulate physiological responses, the use of countermeasures to deceive lie detection methods, and the fabrication of symptoms or behaviors.

Classical approaches to counter malingering include the use of multiple measures and the use of control questions. For example, in the polyggraph, multiple physiological measures are used to detect deception, and control questions are used to establish a baseline response. However, these approaches are often subject to countermeasures, and the effectiveness of these methods is limited.

More recent approaches to counter malingering include the use of psychological measures, such as the Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms (SIRS)~\cite{Wong2005}, and the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in language, facial expressions, and body movements (Yu et al., 2018). For example, machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets of labeled data to identify patterns in language, facial expressions, and body movements that are indicative of malingering.

In conclusion, malingering is a significant challenge in the field of lie detection, and a variety of methods have been developed to counteract it. While classical approaches, such as the use of multiple measures and control questions, have been used for many years, recent advances in technology have enabled the development of more sophisticated methods, such as the use of psychological measures and machine learning algorithms. Further research is needed to develop methods that are robust to malingering and to improve the accuracy of lie detection methods.

The ability to detect lies has long been of interest to researchers from various disciplines, including psychology, sociology, and law enforcement. In recent years, the development of new technologies has enabled the scientific study of lie detection, and has led to the development of a variety of methods for detecting deception. One of the main challenges in lie detection is the issue of malingering, or the intentional manipulation of test results for personal gain. The relationship between lie detection and malingering is complex, and the effectiveness of different lie detection methods is often dependent on the presence of malingering and the methods used to counteract it.

The use of physiological measures, such as polygraphs and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), has been investigated as a means of detecting deception. However, these methods are often subject to countermeasures, such as the use of drugs or other means of manipulating physiological responses, which can reduce their accuracy. As a result, a number of computational approaches have been developed to detect deception, including machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques.

One such approach is the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns in language, facial expressions, and body movements. These algorithms have been trained on large datasets of labeled data, and have been shown to outperform traditional lie detection methods in certain cases. For example, studies have reported accuracy rates of over 90\% for machine learning algorithms that analyze patterns in facial expressions and body movements~\cite{Ekman1992,Yu2018}.

Another approach is the use of computer vision techniques to analyze eye movements, including gaze direction and pupil dilation. These techniques have been shown to be effective in detecting deception, with accuracy rates ranging from 60-80\%~\cite{Ducharme2017,Granziero2019}.

In conclusion, the field of lie detection is a rapidly evolving area of research, and a variety of methods have been developed to detect deception. However, the issue of malingering remains a significant challenge, and the effectiveness of different lie detection methods is often dependent on the presence of malingering and the methods used to counteract it. Further research is needed to develop methods that are robust to malingering and to improve the accuracy of lie detection methods.

% \subsection*{Data Source}
% % In this study, we use sequences for the Haemagglutinnin (HA)  and Neuraminidase (NA) for Influenza A (for subtypes H1N1 and H3N2), which are key enablers of cellular entry and exit mechanisms respectively~\cite{mcauley2019influenza}.
% We use two public sequence databases: 1) National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) virus~\cite{hatcher2017virus} and 2) GISAID~\cite{bogner2006global} databases. The former is a community portal for viral sequence data, aiming to increase the usability of data archived in various NCBI repositories. GISAID has a  more restricted user agreement, and use of GISAID data in an analysis requires acknowledgment of the contributions of both the submitting and the originating laboratories (Corresponding acknowledgment tables are included as supplementary information). We collected a total of $187,294$ sequences in our analysis, although not all were used due to some being duplicates (see \SUPPLEMENTARY Table~S-\ref{tabseq}).

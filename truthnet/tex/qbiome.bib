		  the gut. Preterm infants exhibit defects in gut maturation,
		  weak innate immunity against intestinal infection and
		  increased susceptibility to inflammatory disorders, all of
		  which may be related to the inappropriate microbial
		  colonization of their immature intestines. The earliest
		  microbes to colonize the preterm infant gut encounter a
		  naÃ¯ve, immature intestine. Thus this earliest microbiota
		  potentially has the greatest opportunity to fundamentally
		  influence intestinal development and immune function. The
		  aim of this study was to characterize the effect of early
		  microbial colonization on global gene expression in the
		  distal small intestine during postnatal gut development.\\
		  Gnotobiotic mouse models with experimental colonization by
		  early (prior to two weeks of life) intestinal microbiota
		  from preterm human infants were utilized. Microarray
		  analysis was used to assess global gene expression in the
		  intestinal epithelium.\\ Multiple intestinal genes involved
		  in metabolism, cell cycle regulation, cell-cell or
		  cell-extracellular matrix communication, and immune
		  function are developmental- and intestinal microbiota-
		  regulated. Using a humanized gnotobiotic mouse model, we
		  demonstrate that certain early preterm infant microbiota
		  from prior to 2 weeks of life specifically induce increased
		  NF-ÎºB activation and a phenotype of increased
		  inflammation whereas other preterm microbiota specifically
		  induce decreased NF-ÎºB activation. These fundamental
		  differences correlate with altered clinical outcomes and
		  suggest the existence of optimal early microbial
		  communities to improve health outcomes.}

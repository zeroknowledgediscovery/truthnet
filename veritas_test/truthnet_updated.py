"""
Module for the Veritas framework, a tool designed for training models to identify adversarial behavior 
in structured interviews, such as malingering in mental health diagnosis interviews or computer-aided 
diagnostic tests.

The module includes functionalities for training the Veritas model on a given dataset, calibrating 
decision thresholds, and saving/loading the trained model. It utilizes quasinet for model training 
and SHAP for feature importance analysis.

Classes:
    truthnet: Main class for training and utilizing the Veritas model.

Functions:
    init_globals(model, steps, NSTR): Initializes global variables for parallel processing.
    task(seed): A helper function for parallel task execution.
    load_veritas_model(filepath): Loads a saved Veritas model from a file.
    remove_identical_columns(df): Utility function to remove columns with identical values.

Dependencies:
    - quasinet: For training Q-net models and sampling.
    - pandas: For data manipulation.
    - numpy: For numerical operations.
    - tqdm: For progress bars in loops.
    - dill, gzip: For saving and loading models.
    - shap: For SHAP value computation.
    - scipy: For statistical functions.
    - truthfinder: For specific truth-finding algorithms.
    - distfit: For fitting probability distributions.
    - sklearn: For machine learning metrics.
    - zedstat: For statistical analysis.
    - concurrent.futures: For parallel processing.

Example:
    # Example of using truthnet to train a Veritas model
    tn = truthnet(datapath='path/to/data.csv', target_label='diagnosis')
    tn.fit()
    tn.calibrate()
    tn.save('veritas_model.pkl')
